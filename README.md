# Ptah

A low level HTML creation framework written in rust.

This project aims to provide a full API to generate full HTML pages.
In the far future I want to generate the appropriate CSS files too.

This project is designed to be the basis for a future higher level framework.

All deprecated or experimental HTML elements are not included in the API.
This includes `<script>`, `<noscript>` and `<style>` for now.

## Name

As with all of my projects, this too is named after an ancient deity.
Ptah, one of the Egyptian creation gods, conceived and created the world through the creative power of speech.

Just like him, this library creates a world through the creative power of code.
